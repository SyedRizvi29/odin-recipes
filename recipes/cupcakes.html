    <p>Cupcakes are all the <strong>rage</strong>. Here is a <em>simple</em> recipe that I love to use. You can get as creative as you feel with the decoration by adding colors to the Buttercream and piping it creatively, adding sprinkles, or topping them with coconut, these are great fun to make!</p>
